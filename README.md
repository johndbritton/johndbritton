###  :wave: Hi, I'm John.
- 💼 I’m the Founder of [Raise.dev](https://raise.dev) ([@raisedevs](https://github.com/raisedevs)). We're on a mission to help every developer advance their career.
- 🐙🐱 I worked at GitHub from 2012-2019. While I was there I created [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com), the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), [GitHub Classroom](https://education.github.com/classroom) and a bunch of other stuff to help developers level up.
- 👨‍💻 I mostly build web applications with Ruby on Rails. While I'm far from an expert, I know enough about developing for macOS to be dangerous.
